TaxonLinker uses fuzzy matching to check a list of taxa against scientific names. It requires a dictionary of valid names to check against. This should be a text file called 'TaxonDictionary.txt' saved in the 'var' directory (this can be changed in settings.py). It should be a tab-separated list, with each line consisting of a unique code identifier followed by an accepted scientific name. No text-delimiters should be used. Each column must have a header. There must be at least a column with 'scientificName' as a header; other valid headers are 'taxonID', 'taxonomicStatus' and 'relatedResourceID'. These terms are taken from the TDWG TaxonName ontology. The 'taxonomicStatus' column should contain entries of 'accepted', 'valid', or 'synonym'. It is assumed that any other value (including none) denotes a taxon which is not current, and is not a synonym.
